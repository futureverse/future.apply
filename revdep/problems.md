    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The application appears to have been direct launched using "srun",
    but OMPI was not built with SLURM's PMI support and therefore cannot
    execute. There are several options for building PMI support under
    SLURM, depending upon the SLURM version you are using:
    
      version 16.05 or later: you can use SLURM's PMIx support. This
      requires that you configure and build SLURM --with-pmix.
    
      Versions earlier than 16.05: you must use either SLURM's PMI-1 or
      PMI-2 support. SLURM builds PMI-1 by default, or you can manually
      install PMI-2. You must then build Open MPI using --with-pmi pointing
      to the SLURM PMI library location.
    
    Please configure as appropriate and try again.
